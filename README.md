# Scuffed Anime Collection

This is my personal collection of 'scuffed' anime-style images generated by myself.

When using older models and low step-counts, generative AI often produces artifacts such as broken hands, impossible props and scruffy edges. Sometimes, the combination of these artifacts makes a very artistic result. I refer to this intentionally-rough style as 'scuffed'.

## Collection

### [SQLette](Collection/SQLetteInfo.md)

<img src="Collection/SQLette.png" width=512>

My first 'scuffed' character generated on 2024-12-10. The left hand is malformed and twisted, and the eyes are chiseled like gemstones. Originally created for my [SQLiteSharp](https://github.com/Joy-less/SQLiteSharp) project, SQLette is now the reference for this collection.

### [Jessie](Collection/JessieInfo.md)

This adventurer has a top with a rune-shaped cutout and two belts fused into one. Her backpack and dagger/pen are strangely designed.

### [Levia](Collection/LeviaInfo.md)

<img src="Collection/Levia_4X.png" width=512>

This demon from hell has a hand that seems to melt into their cup. It's difficult to tell whether their appendages are wings, ears, coat-tails, or even mouths.

### [Magazine 1](Collection/Magazine1Info.md)

<img src="Collection/Magazine1_4X.png" width=512>

This magazine back-page seems to speak an alien language. I wonder what it's trying to say?

### [Magazine 2](Collection/Magazine2Info.md)

<img src="Collection/Magazine2_4X.png" width=512>

This magazine front-page seems more like it's trying to advertise something. Are those headphones?

### [Stacie](Collection/StacieInfo.md)

This flame-trooper has seen the end of war. The backpack looks like it's held down by a pipe. The flamethrower's overcomplicated design almost looks steampunk.

## Process

'Scuffed' images can be generated on [Dezgo](https://dezgo.com) with an older model like [FurryToonMix](https://dezgo.com/model/furrytoonmix) or [FurryToonMixV2](https://civitai.com/models/470339/furrytoonmixv2). Reduce the number of steps to 10-15, and AI-upscale the image with [Bigjpg](https://bigjpg.com).
